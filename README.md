Project Objective
In this project, we explore a dataset containing information about restaurant chains worldwide. The main goal is to perform descriptive and statistical analysis to achieve several targeted objectives.

Dataset
The dataset includes details such as the average cost for two, location, votes, aggregate rating, cuisines, country, and rating text. Various analyses are performed, such as identifying the top cuisines, most expensive restaurants, average ratings by country, and more. The dataset is owned by Zomato, and the data is sourced from Kaggle.

Zomato Analysis
Loaded the raw data.
Cleaned the data using Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas by dropping unnecessary columns, removing duplicate rows, and cleaning individual entries.
After cleaning, the data was prepared for developing an interactive dashboard.
Questions
The analysis will address the following questions:

What is the total number of restaurants and cuisines worldwide?
Which countries have the most restaurants listed on Zomato?
Which cities in India have the most "value for money" restaurants?
What are the top 10 cuisines with the highest number of votes in India?
Which countries have restaurants offering online delivery?
Which locality has the most restaurants?
Which restaurants offer good cuisine and have an average rating?
Conclusion
The dataset highlights restaurants with the highest cost for two, countries with the most Zomato-listed restaurants, countries offering online delivery, and average ratings by country.
Based on the analysis, restaurants in various localities can improve quality, offer online delivery, focus on days with higher ratings, and adopt strategies like offering both online delivery and table booking, and providing diverse cuisines.
Frequent visitors can easily filter restaurants based on factors like cost, votes, ratings, and cuisines before visiting.
